# Cyclic variational autoencoder for spectral (and excitation) modeling 

----
This repo will contain a comprehensive implementation of a cyclic variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for:
1. Spectral modeling
2. Joint spectral and excitation modeling

with
1. Continuous latent space (CycleVAE)
2. Discrete latent space (CycleVQVAE)

It is intended mainly for the use of many-to-many (multispeaker) voice conversion (VC) applications.

A part of this package will also contain a system that is submitted for the ZeroSpeech Challenge 2020 with its corresponding paper for the INTERSPEECH 2020.

Neural vocoder implementation and its joint optimization will be added after this VC package is completed.
